Made with react.js and google firebase

All .csv files and .png files were uploaded by me to Google Firebase Cloud Storage

.csv and .png files for time-series data and option chain data are generated by a separate, locally ran python script

TODO: add ability to upload chain .csv and or time series .csv files, as well as suraface .png images to Firebase Cloud Storage in local python script

src/dummy_creds.js represents where you would enter your own Google Firebase project credentials; obfuscated here for obvious reasons, just note that src/firebase.js is referenced in all of the live code instead of src/dummy_creds.js
